    <h2>Batagor is a dish made from tofu.</h2>

    <p>
        Batagor Bandung is a very popular street food found around the Sunda region of Western
        Java. Batagor is an acronym for Bakso Tahu Goreng (Fried Tofu Balls) though it's not
        really a ball, but more of a triangle shape. The tofu is stuffed with a mixture of
        savory ground meat, steamed, and then coated with batter and fried; it is served with
        a spicy sweet chile-peanut sauce.

            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>cold water, or as needed</li>
        <h5>Sauce:</h5>
            <li>⅓ cup water</li>
            <li>¼ cup coarsely chopped dry roasted peanuts</li>
            <li>1 fresh red chile pepper, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons white vinegar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Slice each tofu square diagonally to make 8 triangles. Make a cut into the
                base of each tofu triangle and scoop out enough of tofu to create a pocket.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine scooped-out tofu pieces, prawns, egg, ground chicken, green onion,
                cornstarch, sesame oil, salt, and pepper in a bowl for the filling. Carefully
                stuff filling back into the tofu triangles; the filling will bulge out.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below
                the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add stuffed tofu triangles,
                cover, and steam for 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, make the batter. Mix egg and flour in a bowl. Whisk in enough water
                to give batter a medium-thin consistency.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine water, peanuts, red chile pepper, garlic, vinegar, salt, and sugar
                in a bowl. Stir until salt and sugar have dissolved and set sauce aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove cooked tofu triangles from the steamer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a wok until hot. Dip triangles into the batter and slowly lower
                into the hot oil. Fry in batches until golden brown and the batter is cooked
                through, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Serve hot with the peanut
                sauce.
            </li>
        </ol>
